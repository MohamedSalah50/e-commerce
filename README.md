## 🗑️ Freeze / Restore / Remove Pattern

Brand, Category, and Product all follow a 3-state lifecycle:

```
Active → freeze() → Frozen → restore() → Active
                  → remove() → Permanently Deleted
```

- **freeze**: sets `freezedAt`, document hidden from public queries
- **restore**: removes `freezedAt`, document becomes active again
- **remove**: hard delete, only allowed when already frozen

| Role    | Description            |
